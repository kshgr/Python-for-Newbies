## Who is it for?

This course is aimed towards complete beginners with absolutely 0 prior experience writing code.
We will go over all the topics from scratch, in order to make it easy for anyone with any background to be able to grasp the concepts.

(If you have prior experience writing code with other languages and wish to learn Python, you are welcome to watch this series, you might find many topics easier to grasp than others.)

## What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language, created by Guido von Rossum, back in 1990. This stable and mature language is very high-level, dynamic, object-oriented and cross-platform, all charecteristics that are very attractive to developers.

## Why Python?

Python Provides a unique mix of elegance, simplicity, practicallity and power.
It is easy to learn, so it is quite suitable if you're new to programming.

## Course style

Now comes the fun part, this course is not going to be all theoretical knowledge and learning syntaxes. No. 

After every few concepts we will be using those to create small projects of our own, to test our ability and use our newly accquired skills, because there is no better way to learn than to try it out yourself!

Near the end of this course we will also be creating one bigger project that utilises all of our newly accquired python skills.

## Bonus Tip

If you've made it so far, let me give you a bonus tip, my mantra to learn.

I believe in learning by failing. Yes, you read it correct, by failing.
If you have questions like "Can I do X with Python?" or "How to do X?", your first action should be trying it yourself, to the best of your logical , rather than a quick internet search, don't be afraid to run into errors! 
By doing this you not only learn what to do but also what not to do!


Happy Coding!
